🏎️ F1 Predictions 2025 - Machine Learning Model

Welcome to the F1 Predictions 2025 repository! This project uses machine learning, FastF1 API data, and historical F1 race results to predict race outcomes for the 2025 Formula 1 season.

🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a Gradient Boosting Machine Learning model that predicts race results based on past performance, qualifying times, and other structured F1 data. The model leverages:

FastF1 API for historical race data
2024 race results
2025 qualifying session results
Over the course of the season we will be adding additional data to improve our model as well
Feature engineering techniques to improve predictions
📊 Data Sources

FastF1 API: Fetches lap times, race results, and telemetry data
2025 Qualifying Data: Used for prediction
Historical F1 Results: Processed from FastF1 for training the model
🏁 How It Works

Data Collection: The script pulls relevant F1 data using the FastF1 API.
Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Converts lap times, normalizes driver names, and structures race data.
Model Training: A Gradient Boosting Regressor is trained using 2024 race results.
Prediction: The model predicts race times for 2025 and ranks drivers accordingly.
Evaluation: Model performance is measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Dependencies

fastf1
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
File Structure

For every race the end of the file will be numbered in correlation to the race on the calendar, ex. prediction1 - Australia, prediction2 - China, etc.
